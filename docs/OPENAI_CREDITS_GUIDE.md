# OpenAI API Credits Guide

## üéØ Quick Summary

You need to add credits to your OpenAI account to use the API for generating embeddings. Here's how to do it step-by-step.

## üìç Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Access Your OpenAI Account
1. **Go to**: https://platform.openai.com/
2. **Sign in** with your OpenAI account credentials
3. **Click on your profile** (top-right corner)

### Step 2: Navigate to Billing
1. Click on **"Settings"** or **"Billing"** from the dropdown menu
2. Or go directly to: https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview

### Step 3: Add Payment Method
1. Look for **"Payment methods"** section
2. Click **"Add payment method"**
3. Enter your **credit/debit card** details:
   - Card number
   - Expiration date
   - CVV/CVC code
   - Billing address
4. Click **"Save"** or **"Add card"**

### Step 4: Add Credits
You have two options:

#### Option A: Manual Credit Purchase (Recommended for Testing)
1. Go to **"Billing"** ‚Üí **"Add credits"**
2. Choose an amount:
   - **$5** - Good for testing (covers ~5,000-10,000 messages)
   - **$10** - Recommended for your full ingestion (~13,719 messages)
   - **$20+** - If you plan to use the API regularly
3. Click **"Continue"** or **"Purchase"**
4. Confirm the payment

#### Option B: Auto-Recharge (Recommended for Regular Use)
1. Go to **"Billing"** ‚Üí **"Auto-recharge"**
2. Enable auto-recharge
3. Set:
   - **Recharge amount**: $10-$20
   - **Trigger threshold**: When balance drops below $5
4. This ensures you never run out of credits

### Step 5: Verify Credits
1. Go back to **Billing Overview**
2. Check that your **"Credit balance"** shows the amount you added
3. Wait 1-2 minutes for the system to update

## üí∞ Cost Breakdown for Your Project

### Your Sparky Ingestion
- **Total messages**: ~13,719
- **Embedding model**: `text-embedding-3-small`
- **Cost per 1M tokens**: $0.020
- **Average tokens per message**: ~100-200 tokens
- **Estimated total tokens**: ~1.4-2.7M tokens
- **Estimated cost**: **$0.03-$0.05** (very cheap!)

### Why You Might Need More
The actual cost is very low, but you might need credits for:
- **Rate limits**: Free tier has very low limits
- **Minimum purchase**: OpenAI typically requires minimum $5 purchase
- **Future use**: Additional API calls, testing, etc.

### Recommended Purchase
**$10** - This will:
- ‚úÖ Cover your entire Sparky ingestion (200x over)
- ‚úÖ Provide buffer for retries and errors
- ‚úÖ Leave credits for future API usage
- ‚úÖ Unlock higher rate limits

## üîë Important Notes

### API Keys vs Credits
- **API Key**: You already have this (in your `.env` file)
- **Credits**: Money in your OpenAI account to pay for API usage
- **Both are required**: Key authenticates you, credits pay for usage

### Billing Plans
OpenAI has different tiers:

1. **Free Tier** (Your current situation)
   - Very limited rate limits
   - Often causes 429 errors
   - Not suitable for batch processing

2. **Pay-as-you-go** (Recommended)
   - Add credits as needed
   - Higher rate limits
   - Only pay for what you use
   - **This is what you need**

3. **Prepaid Credits**
   - Buy credits in advance
   - No monthly commitment
   - Credits don't expire (for 1 year)

### Rate Limits After Adding Credits
Once you add credits, your rate limits increase:
- **Free tier**: 3 requests/minute, 200 requests/day
- **Paid tier 1**: 500 requests/minute, 10,000 requests/day
- **Higher tiers**: Even more capacity

## üö® Troubleshooting

### "Continue" Button Greyed Out
This is a common issue. Try:
1. **Clear browser cache** and cookies
2. **Try a different browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
3. **Disable browser extensions** (especially ad blockers)
4. **Use incognito/private mode**
5. **Try on mobile device** if desktop doesn't work

### Payment Method Not Accepted
- **Check card details** are correct
- **Ensure international payments** are enabled on your card
- **Try a different card** (Visa/Mastercard work best)
- **Contact your bank** - they might be blocking the transaction
- **Try PayPal** if available in your region

### Credits Not Showing Up
- **Wait 2-5 minutes** for the system to update
- **Refresh the page** (hard refresh: Ctrl+F5)
- **Check email** for payment confirmation
- **Contact OpenAI support** if still not showing after 10 minutes

### Still Getting 429 Errors After Adding Credits
- **Wait 5-10 minutes** for rate limits to update
- **Check billing overview** to confirm credits are there
- **Verify your API key** is correct in `.env` file
- **Try a test API call** to confirm it's working

## ‚úÖ After Adding Credits

Once you've successfully added credits:

### 1. Verify Credits
```bash
# Check your billing page shows positive balance
# URL: https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview
```

### 2. Test API Access
```bash
# Run a quick test
C:\Python313\python.exe test_connectivity.py
```

### 3. Resume Ingestion
```bash
# Start the ingestion process
C:\Python313\python.exe ingest_sparky_export.py chat-history
```

### 4. Monitor Progress
```bash
# In another terminal, check progress
C:\Python313\python.exe check_ingestion_progress.py --estimate-time
```

## üìä Expected Timeline

After adding credits:
- **Setup time**: 5-10 minutes (adding credits, verification)
- **Ingestion time**: 8-12 hours (can run in sessions)
- **Total cost**: ~$0.03-$0.10 (very affordable!)

## üí° Pro Tips

### Save Money
1. **Use the cheapest embedding model**: `text-embedding-3-small` (already configured)
2. **Filter content wisely**: The script already filters out low-value content
3. **Monitor usage**: Check the usage dashboard regularly

### Avoid Issues
1. **Add more than you need**: $10 is safer than $5
2. **Enable auto-recharge**: Prevents interruptions
3. **Keep payment method updated**: Expired cards cause issues
4. **Monitor rate limits**: Don't run multiple scripts simultaneously

### Best Practices
1. **Start with $10**: Good balance of cost and capacity
2. **Run in sessions**: 1-2 hours at a time, resume as needed
3. **Check progress regularly**: Use the progress checker
4. **Keep the resume file**: Don't delete `sparky_ingestion_progress.json` until complete

## üéâ Ready to Go!

Once you've added credits:
1. ‚úÖ Your API quota will be restored
2. ‚úÖ Rate limits will be increased
3. ‚úÖ The ingestion script will work smoothly
4. ‚úÖ Resume mechanism will track all progress

The entire process should be smooth and affordable. Your 544 conversations will be safely ingested into your context management system! üöÄ
